### Project 1: Predicting Bitcoin in Feburary, 2018

Code Author: Anh Hong Le

#### Project description: 
- Read data into Jupyter notebook, use pandas to import data into a data frame
- preprocess data: explore data, address missing data, categorical data, if there is any, and data scaling. Justify the type of scaling used in this project. 
- train your dataset using all the linear regression models you've learned so far. If your model has a scaling parameter(s) use Grid Search to find the best scaling parameter. Use plots and graphs to help you get a better glimpse of the results. 
- Then use cross validation to find average training and testing score. 
- Your submission should have at least the following regression models: KNN repressor, linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, polynomial regression, SVM both simple and with kernels. 
- Finally find the best repressor for this dataset and train your model on the entire dataset using the best parameters and predict the market price for the test_set.
